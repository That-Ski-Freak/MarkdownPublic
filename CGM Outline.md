- In the early 90s richard garfield and co created magic the gathering
	- quick rundown of where we are now. How did we get here?
	- There have been countless other games, different models, pc and mobile games, but it seems like few if any have really fixed things from a consumer perspective


- beginning
	- In the early 90s richard garfield and co created magic the gathering
	- it spawned an entire genre, both in terms of gameplay and business model, and countless games followed, both in paper and on pc/mobile. Many have come and gone, all of varying gameplay quality and monetization, and a few including magic have stood the test of time in one way or another.
	- This year was magic the gathering's 30th anniversary, and they remade the original first set of cards, the og duals, ancestral recall, the black lotus, all being reprinted and sold in brand new packs to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the game, with the catch that the cards wouldn't be tournament legal and effectively proxy cards. Oh, and it cost 1000 dollars and you get 4 packs.
	- clips of people talking about magic 30, maro saying secret lair fetchlands costs a lot because of the box, other extremely egregious card game statements ideally some from some other games too, maybe someone being like 'oh its only 500 dollar deck' or something
	- How did we get here?
- starting from the 90s and going through the events that transpired, mostly trying to pick things out that support the main points and issues outlined in the information doc for this script and my original thing I wrote about card game monetization for project gamma
- ok so what even theoretically could work best from the consumer perspective?
