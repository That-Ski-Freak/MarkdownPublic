Card game distribution

----

Magic started the whole card game dings, and it sold packs mostly. They branched out a little bit, but their model is still predominantly around selling packs with random cards of different rarities. They intentionally keep the value of cards high, so in order to get a real deck in most formats you are looking at 200-1000 dollars, which is absolutely absurd. They are incentivized to keep this going because it makes more money for them. This model is fundamentally at odds with not only making an accessible and enjoyable game for players, but also a *good* game.

With this model you end up making a lot of useless cards, and purposely having to make chase cards that will get people excited to buy packs, this is at odds with balance. Of course, with cards being so expensive, many people will be priced out, it will be to some extent pay to play at an equal playing field, and you will not be able to experience as much variety as having multiple decks will be unaffordable. Also they are greatly conflicted when it comes to balance and bannings, you can't nerf physical cards, so they need to ban them, and then the people who bought them for $15 a pop will be upset that they lost all their value. This creates a weird song and dance where they try to avoid banning new cards and avoid bannings as much as possible, but also try to print as flashy cards as they can to sell more packs.

Fast forward 20 years, fantasy flight games decides I believe starting with netrunner that they want to try something different, they call it a living card game, as opposed to magic being a trading card game. The idea here is that you continually create full expansions and then sell full sets of the cards to players, often on a subscription service. This makes it much more affordable to have all the cards if you want them. Despite this being less predatory and overall cheaper if you are a long term player, these games never really got very far no matter how many they made and how critically acclaimed they were. The only card game in recent memory to reach comparable heights to magic pokemon and yu gi oh is flesh and blood, which came out in 2019, is a tcg, and top decks can cost up to 1k

As far as I can tell this stems from a few factors, most notably that they do a poor job of facilitating local events at game stores, and the buy in can feel steep and actually get steep over time. The second is fairly straightforward, if you continually release new expansions, existing players will be happy because they can just pay their 20$ every few months to get the new cards, but as time goes on the barrier to entry starts to become fairly large, and can actually be worse on the buy in for a new player than a tcg like magic. These 'expandable' card games seem to have made very little attempt to solve this problem.

Also, if you just want to make a new deck you would need cards from multiple expansions, which means you would need to buy those expansions even if you only want some of the cards because there isn't really a secondary market. On top of this, if you can only get your full playset of each card, then if you want to have multiple decks built at a time that use the same cards between them, you would either need to move them or buy alll the cards again. The only real solution to these is ensuring that the secondary market and trade values of the cards stay extremely low, under a dollar, ideally 25-50 cents, valued by the product of the piece of cardboard rather than the rarity.

The problem of facilitating local events is a bit trickier. In order to have events, you need to basically already have players, you need to keep them long term, and you need to get new players in over time. You also need to give 3rd parties an incentive to actually host events, which in a tcg like magic is much greater because there is more money moving around through the secondary market, and products for long time players to buy such as cosmetics, and products for idiots with lots of money to buy, like packs.


You need to be able to enter in with as little investment as possible, you need to be able to get individual or extra copies of cards for fairly cheap, and the cost to acquire large amounts or all game pieces that you want can’t end up being absurdly expensive.

Along with this, overall game pieces must be cheap, there probably needs to be some amount of secondary market, and you probably need some amount of packs.

Overall these requirements lead to a really tricky cost optimization problem trying to find the way to get the most cards distributed to the most players as cheaply and in the most efficient groupings as possible, where the solution is probably a selection of key products that do not overlap significantly to avoid confusion in what to buy.

If I had to guess right now what that may consist of I would say:
- full expansions sold with all the cards. If you’re a hard core player you can just get all the damn cards if you want. This can double as a sort of board game set with a number of pre constructed decks. It can also be available as a subscription service because those make money.
- top tier decks sold in near optimal configurations, to make it easy to point new players to the thing they need to get to participate and compete on an equal level. (In tcgs like magic they are greatly incentivized to NEVER and they do never just sell you the cards you want, wizards of the coast will never just sell you a full optimized deck.)
- packs with cosmetics, maybe all cards are the same rarity but the different cosmetics are rarer than others, so you only get 5 foils and one super fancy thing per pack for example. This would have to combine with players having extra cards from the other things to create enough supply of singles. The overall goal here would be to give the collector and high value to cards that are just cosmetics of normal cards, so that actual game pieces you need to play the game can be available at as low a cost as possible. I don't know if this would actually work, it might not, it's possible nobody would want to buy this.
- The ultimate silver bullet for solving everything would be to just sell single cards print to order for 50 cents a card. This would be literally printing money, and put a cap the card prices. This would be absolutely ideal if the logistics of it actually work, you would need enough orders coming through to be able to have the economies of scale for printing individual cards to order (perhaps you print them once a week all at once after collecting the week's orders?), and hopefully it wouldn't take too long to get to the consumer. This would work a lot better if the game is already successful and has enough players to support having some amount of stock for cards, although it would still be tricky as they would not all be in the same amount of demand.


Overall this plan would be giving up the potential for the kind of insane money that games like magic and pokemon make, but it's prioritizing growth and quality of the game, which is imo more important, and also is arguably more important from a business perspective at this point anyway, since you need to be able to compete with already existing games and being 100x less expensive could be a great way to do that.
