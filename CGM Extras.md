Card game monetization: a 30 year train wreck
Information page

[[card game distribution]] useful


### thesis:
Is it even possible to create a model that will finance a paper card game and not be horrible? The failure of the expandable card games is worrying along with the success of flesh and blood for example

maybe follow the emplemon video format of hungrybox never ever somewhat?

Games: magic the gathering, flesh and blood,  pokemon, yu gi oh, netrunner, ashes, hearthstone, mtgo, magic arena, legends of runeterra, artifact, marvel snap, artifact

Models: TCG/ccg, lcg/expandable card game, the different digital ones
keyforge?

### Questions:
- lorcana? keyforge? eternal? arena? what are these games doing?
- is there an alternative to local game stores? I feel like all I hear about them is that they are losing money and as far as I can tell they basically function as a big room with tables most of the time when it comes to magic.
- japan vs us, other countries languages, how they tried their own things. 'I feel like japan and the gacha stuff is very similar, its all just packs/loot boxes with rarity etc, but ill look closer'

**List of info:**
- wotc can't mention the cards being worth money
- Why is the card game monetization tolerated?
- "investment"
- runeterra finishing the region roads and not having enough cards. the region roads probably worked great when the game had a third of the cards it does now. you can grind path of champions as well and surrendering over and over gives xp
- the ccg bubble in the early days
- the more recent kickstarter card games
- the patent for mtg received criticism
- one company was going to pay wotc for the patent?
- wotc bought by hasbro?
- possibly talk about x wing?
- rotation as an answer to power creep and new cards
- magic having less draft chaff these days
- chronicles and the following complaints from collectors of the game devaluing their collections
- in the beginning the collectability of the cards was one of the main selling points, but that diminished quickly possibly? and now seems to be less relevent and the players who just care about the gameplay are ostracized 
- a core issue is players being given an implicit promise that they may pay a lot of money for cards but they will be able to liquidate their assets and sell out later.
- Mobile games, scoffed at, loot boxes in overwatch but they contain game pieces, pc gamers have other options. There is no other option.
- [https://youtu.be/4rWMENORkCc?si=ZGvn1caBNn3ER2vx&t=153](https://youtu.be/4rWMENORkCc?si=ZGvn1caBNn3ER2vx&t=153 "https://youtu.be/4rWMENORkCc?si=ZGvn1caBNn3ER2vx&t=153") this is kind of an interesting way of having collectability with packs and without getting duplicate cards. i guess thats not ass necessary if you expect people to trade cards more but it does remove the gambling aspect
- flesh and blood, started with high prices that got investors involved, but the prices haven't fallen. the spring tunic card
- in the end you have a lot more freedom when it comes to video games to simply be more consumer friendly, mostly because you don't need to deal with physical goods. Yes there are still many other costs that you need to cover, but if you want to just give players more cards you can do that without having to print and ship them. In real life we have a bit of a conundrum though, all the popular games are the ones
- needs to be expandable
- expandable games offer players a unique opportunity / lifestyle game, 
- hearthstone cemented the genre in the digital realm
- "I highly doubt it’s as profitable as _League of Legends._ And the [working theory](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/doFzupSFOgo) is that it exists chiefly to get players to play Riot’s other games (and provide a convenient alternative to Blizzard’s ecosystem)." Is Lor a loss leader? Riot said they dont expect lor to turn a profit, so why do they do it?
- trend of games having more and more bloated monetization over time, possibly an attempt to collect more money while seemingly improving the game without actually making it more accessible but often rather less so
- gambling laws
- recently limited has way less garbage
- pokemon leveraging pop culture to separate the things from the game
- The difference between tcg/ccg as a model and the gameplay genre
- for digital, the difference between card games and other free online as a service games
- the incentive structures that these monetization models create are antithetical to creating a good game, they conflict
- public companies & shareholders
- packs are used for draft / sealed, lacking in lcg
- grapple with the arguments with slowly collecting cards, and the differences between that and something like LoL or apex
- having access to cards be severely limited discourages players from trying new things
- Is it even possible to create a model that will finance a paper card game and not be horrible? The failure of the expandable card games is worrying along with the success of flesh and blood for example
- question the relationship for collectors and players
- 30th anniversary
- lgs model
- judge and prize cards?
- the complaints of magic dying constantly rolling in over the years, some legitimate and many just idiots, in the end the game isn't dying as a game but may have died in other ways
- instances of wotc being very tone deaf and ignorant to people being upset with their bs
- hasbro plan to double money they make from wotc
- probably mention my own project
- just saying 'oh reprint more cards' 'print more of the cards people actually play that cost more' will only get you so far, the actual structure needs to change in order to actually achieve the goals of reducing card prices & xyz, and the structure needs to be in place so that things don't shift to become worse over time as the owners of the game are slowly incentivized to inch closer and closer to things that are worse for the game and good for profits.
- we must create a model that aligns the interests of the players with the interests of the creators of the game.
- the core point, collecting and trading, and how both are made worse by cards having monetary value
- deckbuilding games like dominion followed, was the first deck building game
- ppl investing are not the problem they only carry it out, dont hate the player hate the game, rudi alpha investments. 
- trading cards with other people feels weird when you need to check values on your phone, https://discord.com/channels/@me/1046261649461498006/1149037248738775103 conversation with birdsandbees about it and scarcity and barter
- magic created both a gameplay genre and business model
- related to rarity in draft and issues of that nature, acting like more powerful cards being rarer fixes anything is essentially buying into the bullshit reasons that don't actually exist in reality
- lor, weird theories on how the game is better to play than watch, riot failing to offer cosmetics and not marketing the game
- loot boxes and issues with them (is hearthstone banned in the countries that ban loot boxes?)

Magic spesifically:
- 30th anniversary, how did we get here?
- pro tour
- the reserved list
- more products?
- the truth is magic has always been changing, it's always been better in some ways and worse in others, and when players enter the game they get used to and like the way things currently are, so when it changes the people who were not only used to how it was but possibly that was the reason they were playing the game are probably not going to like it. Is a game where theres stuff from diff ips a bad idea? no, but the playerbase always came for the current thing. Universes beyond is not an inherently bad idea, smash ultimate the card game sounds cool, but its not what people signed up for. product is not for you doesnt apply when you need the product to remain competitive
- its grown to so much more than a competitive game
- challenger decks and precursors
- 

concepts such as tempo etc would begin to show up and people would do writing on strategy as the games aged

Potential info:
- 'mmos have been using a collectible model but you put in time instead of dollars'

Media:
- maro on tolarian community college with secret lair fetchlands, saying that it costs more because of the box
- richard garfield 'if it worked we would be rich at least'
- scrooge

writing:
- Magic players: You're not going to get anywhere begging for reprints, it's always going to be one step forwards two steps back with wotc.
